	<h1>who we are?</h1>
	<p>
Imagine that the world runs right, and there’s a place that offers clothing for the whole women. Imagine that everything it sells has great style & quality, at a price you can’t believe. That place exists – this is Aurore.


Aurore is an apparel and accessories brand for the entire family. We make women’s clothing, men’s clothing and kids clothing and we believe in the democracy of style, the power of fun & the joy of fashion. We celebrate being frugally innovative and deliver incredible style at incredible value for absolutely everyone. We’re not high fashion, we’re hi, fashion!


Aurore makes shopping fun again – with a commitment to quality and innovation, paired with a modern style sensibility, we deliver must-have styles for baby, toddler, kids, men & women, including one of the widest range of sizes in the business, with over 201 sizes including petite, plus & tall.


Aurore is the #1 dress brand in America, and our denim is truly world-class (making butts happy since ’94!). We make some of the best activewear in the industry for a price you won’t find anywhere else.


Our commitment to sustainability is about leaving the earth better than we found it for our kids (and their kids and their kids) – so we are working hard towards a goal of 100% cotton that is sourced sustainably, and 100% denim made with water-saving techniques.


Founded in 1994 in San Francisco, CA to bring style to the people Aurore now has over 1100 stores, and over 4 million visitors to our website every year. We believe that here, everyone is family, and that belonging has never been a trend. We can’t wait to see you in the store or on the site!


P.S. If you’re in a hurry, we also offer unparalleled convenience with Buy Online, Pickup In-Store! We don’t just make shopping fun again…we make it easy too.
